Geometry managers are used to specify the relative positioning of widgets within 
their container - their mutual master. 
In contrast to the more cumbersome placer (which is used less commonly, 
and we do not cover here), the packer takes qualitative relationship specification - 
above, to the left of, filling, etc - and works everything out to determine the exact 
placement coordinates for you.""",font=(20),padx=50,pady=50,foreground="red")
